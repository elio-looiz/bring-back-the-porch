It’s amazing how quickly a routine becomes a part of you. For so many of us in Medicine Hat, that routine included the familiar faces and stories from CHAT Television. Its closure left a void, and in the quiet that followed, a question emerged: What now?

That question is the spark behind **Bring Back the Porch**.

We believe that a community’s stories don’t just disappear when one platform goes dark. They live on in our local businesses, our community leaders, our artists, and our neighbours. The conversations that once happened on the front porch—the sharing of news, the friendly debates, the retelling of great memories—are what knit a community together. Our goal is to create a new digital porch for Medicine Hat and the surrounding area.

Our podcast will be a place for long-form, thoughtful conversations. We want to go beyond the headlines and explore the "why" behind the stories. We’ll sit down with the people shaping our city, from entrepreneurs launching new ventures on 2nd Street to the community organizers planning the future of our parks and recreation.

But we won't stop there. We’re also excited to continue producing video features, including the beloved historical series *Stories from Our Town*, to visually capture the people and events that make this region so unique.

This isn't just about filling a void; it's about building something that reflects the Medicine Hat of today and tomorrow. It’s about creating a space where new ideas can be shared and where the spirit of our community can be amplified.

We are a small, dedicated team with the professional tools ready to go. Now, we're turning to you, the community. Your listenership is our primary goal, but if you believe in this mission, any financial support will directly fuel our ability to tell more stories. Whether through a small donation or a business sponsorship, your contribution helps us switch the lights on and keep them burning bright.

The porch light is on. We hope you’ll join us for a conversation.
